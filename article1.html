                                <p>As humans and dogs both have different metabolism, they also need to consume different foods. This is why food that is healthy and natural for humans might prove hazardous for your dogs. If your dog consumes some specific human foods, they might suffer from serious poisoning. In worst-case scenarios, they may face death.
                                <br><br>
                                On the other hand, numerous human foods are perfect for your dogs and they can consume these foods without any health risks. In this article, we will discuss foods that your dogs can eat and cannot eat. </p>

                                <h3>ü•ï Carrots: Consumable</h3>

                                <p>If you‚Äôre thinking of feeding carrots to your dogs, you can go for it. Whether you feed them cooked or raw carrots, they will be able to digest the carrots easily.
                                <br><br>
                                Carrots are not only a great source of minerals, vitamins, and fiber, but they are also low in calories. This is why carrots are super healthy food for your dogs. But make sure you don‚Äôt over-feed them or they will become obese.
                                <br><br>
                                But before you feed the carrots, consider cutting them into small pieces so that your dog doesn‚Äôt choke.</p>

                                <h3>üßÇ Salt: Limited Consumption</h3>

                                <p>While including salt in your dog‚Äôs diet, make sure the quantity is limited. If your dog consumes an excessive amount of salt, it will develop salt poisoning. They can also develop water deprivation that will lead to diarrhea, vomiting, and seizures. In some severe cases, it can prove fatal.
                                <br><br>
                                If you want to prevent the adverse effects, make sure you avoid feeding your dog salted foods such as pretzels and chips. Additionally, make sure your dog drinks plenty of water so that your dog can prevent water deprivation.</p>

                                <h3>ü•ú Peanut Butter: Consumable</h3>

                                <p>Peanut butter is undoubtedly one of the healthiest and safest foods for dogs. When consumed in a moderate amount, peanut butter will prove beneficial for your dogs. 
                                <br> <br>
                                However, don‚Äôt forget to limit the intake of peanut butter. This is because peanut butter is extremely high in calories and fat. If your dog eats too much, it will gain excess weight. 
                                <br> <br>
                                Additionally, ensure that your dog is consuming unsalted and plain peanut butter. There are different types of peanut butter available in the market that comes in different flavors such as chocolate, mango, etc. The peanut butter might contain salt which will prove fatal for your dog.</p>

                                <h3>ü•ö Eggs: Consumable</h3>

                                <p>Full-boiled and half-boiled eggs are perfect foods for dogs if you‚Äôre concerned about their nutrition. Adding eggs to their diet is one of the most effective ways to prevent them from suffering vitamin depreciation. 
                                <br> <br>
                                Apart from protein, one cooked egg will also provide a sufficient amount of minerals and vitamins. Some reports stated that eggs can help dogs tackle nausea, even though there is no scientific research backing this claim. 
                                <br> <br>
                                But keep in mind that feeding raw eggs to your dog might cause complications. Even though dogs don‚Äôt suffer from serious health complications after consuming raw eggs, bacteria can spread to humans from dogs, which will cause infection. </p>

                                <h3>üê† Salmon: Consumable</h3>

                                <p>Boneless and cooked salmon is perfectly safe for your dogs. They will never get any infection or suffer from any health issues by eating cooked salmon. 
                                <br> <br>
                                Salmon is the best source of omega-3 fatty acids, which is effective at reducing overall inflammation. They can also keep the fur and skin healthy. 
                                <br> <br>
                                But just like eggs, feeding raw salmon to your dogs is not suggested. This is because raw salmon might contain a parasite that can prove fatal.</p>

                                <h3>üßÄ Cheese: Limited Consumption</h3>

                                <p>Cheese is a safe consumable food for dogs as long as you‚Äôre feeding it to your dog in small quantities. Due to the lactose and fat content of the cheese, some dogs might suffer from digestive problems, such as diarrhea and pain. And if your dog consumes too much cheese, make sure you visit a veterinarian as soon as possible. 
                                <br> <br>
                                But to prevent severe symptoms from occurring in the first place, it‚Äôs best if you increase the cheese amount in your dog‚Äôs diet gradually. Consider feeding mozzarella as this is low-fat cheese.</p>

                                <h3>üçá Blueberries: Consumable</h3>

                                <p>Blueberries are one of the safest and most nutritious for your dogs. They are a great source of antioxidants that will help your dog fight diseases. They also contain a significant amount of minerals, vitamins, and fiber, all of which will prove beneficial for your dog‚Äôs health. 
                                <br> <br>
                                As blueberries are small in size, your dog won‚Äôt choke. Due to the low calories, they are a super conscious treat for your dog.</p>

                                <h3>üçø Popcorn: Consumable</h3>

                                <p>If you‚Äôre searching for occasional treats for your dogs, consider choosing popcorn. But it‚Äôs healthy as long as it‚Äôs free of any additional ingredients. 
                                <br> <br>
                                If you‚Äôve noticed, many popcorns are salted as salt is one of the most important ingredients of popcorn. Therefore, if your dog consumes an excess amount of popcorn, it might suffer from serious complications. Oil and butter are also other common popcorn ingredient that is high in fat. Therefore, your dog might suffer from pancreatitis if it‚Äôs consumed too much. 
                                <br> <br>
                                This is why you should always feed your dog air-popped and ordinary popcorn. Caramel and chocolate popcorns are the most dangerous pet hazards for your dogs. Keep in mind that popcorn can get stuck in your dog‚Äôs teeth.</p>

                                <h3>üå∞ Cashews: Limited Consumption</h3>

                                <p>If your dog is consuming too many cashews, limit their intake as soon as possible. When consumed in small amounts, the unsalted, pain, and roasted cashews will not prove harmful for your dogs. However, remember that cashews are extremely high in calories as well as fat which might cause excess weight gain. 
                                <br> <br>
                                Apart from that, reports also stated that cashews are responsible for causing allergic reactions in dogs. So if you notice your dog is suffering from an allergic reaction, make sure you limit cashew intake as fast as possible. 
                                </p>

                                <h3>üê∂ Conclusion</h3>
                                
                                <p>These are the foods that your dog can eat and cannot eat. Make sure you let us know if you have any more questions.</p>
